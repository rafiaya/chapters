      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human-made structure in space and serves as a living laboratory for science, technology, and international cooperation. It orbits the Earth approximately every 90 minutes, traveling at a speed of 28,000 km/h.</p>

      <h3>History and Development</h3>
      <p>The ISS began construction in 1998 and has been continuously inhabited since 2000. It was built through the collaboration of five main space agencies: <strong>NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada)</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Structure and Modules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Laboratory Modules:</strong> Conduct scientific experiments in biology, physics, medicine, and space technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Living Quarters:</strong> Provide space for astronauts to sleep, eat, and exercise.</li>
        <li><strong>Solar Panels:</strong> Generate electricity to power the entire station.</li>
        <li><strong>Docking Ports:</strong> Allow spacecraft from Earth to bring supplies, equipment, and crew.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scientific Research</h3>
      <p>The ISS provides a unique environment of microgravity that allows experiments impossible on Earth. Key areas of research include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical studies on how space affects the human body.</li>
        <li>Experiments in fluid dynamics and material science.</li>
        <li>Observing Earthâ€™s climate, natural disasters, and environmental changes.</li>
        <li>Testing technologies needed for future Moon and Mars missions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>International Cooperation</h3>
      <p>The ISS stands as a symbol of peace and collaboration. Countries around the world contribute resources, technology, and astronauts, making it a true global partnership in space exploration.</p>

      <h3>Future of the ISS</h3>
      <p>The ISS is expected to operate until at least 2030. After that, it may be replaced by commercial space stations and platforms that will continue research and pave the way for deep space exploration.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The International Space Station is a shining example of what humanity can achieve when nations work together. It has advanced science, inspired generations, and laid the foundation for future space missions beyond Earth.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The <strong>International Space Station (ISS)</strong> is one of the greatest achievements in human space exploration. It is a large spacecraft orbiting Earth where astronauts from multiple countries live and work together. Launched in 1998, the ISS represents international cooperation in science, engineering, and exploration.</p>

      <h3>Construction and Design</h3>
      <p>The ISS was built piece by piece in space, with contributions from the United States (NASA), Russia (Roscosmos), Europe (ESA), Japan (JAXA), and Canada (CSA). It is about the size of a football field and can be seen from Earth with the naked eye as it orbits around 400 km above the planet.</p>

      <h3>Life Aboard the ISS</h3>
      <p>Astronauts aboard the ISS conduct scientific experiments, study the effects of microgravity, and test technologies needed for future missions to the Moon and Mars. They eat, sleep, and even exercise in microgravity to maintain their health during long stays in space.</p>

      <h3>Scientific Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical Research:</strong> Studying human health in space helps improve treatments on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Earth Observation:</strong> Monitoring climate, natural disasters, and environmental changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Testing:</strong> Developing systems for deep-space exploration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>International Cooperation</h3>
      <p>The ISS stands as a symbol of peace and global collaboration. Despite political differences on Earth, astronauts from many nations work side by side in space, showing what humanity can achieve when united.</p>

      <h3>Future of the ISS</h3>
      <p>The ISS is expected to operate until at least 2030. Beyond that, it may be replaced by new commercial space stations or serve as a stepping stone for deep-space missions, including journeys to Mars.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The International Space Station is more than just a spacecraftâ€”it is a laboratory, a home, and a bridge to the future of space exploration. Its legacy will inspire future generations to reach even farther into the cosmos.</p>

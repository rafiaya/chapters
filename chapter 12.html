      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The universe is not static—it’s expanding. Galaxies are, on average, moving away from each other as space itself stretches.
        This insight reshaped modern cosmology and explains observations such as the cosmic redshift and the cosmic microwave background.
      </p>

      <h3>Hubble’s Law</h3>
      <p>
        In the late 1920s, Edwin Hubble found a simple relationship between a galaxy’s distance (<em>d</em>) and how fast it appears to recede from us (<em>v</em>):
      </p>
      <p style="margin:8px 0; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">v = H<sub>0</sub> × d</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>v (recession speed):</strong> How fast a galaxy appears to move away due to cosmic expansion.</li>
        <li><strong>d (distance):</strong> The galaxy’s distance from us (usually in megaparsecs, Mpc).</li>
        <li><strong>H<sub>0</sub> (Hubble constant):</strong> The present-day expansion rate of the universe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The linear relation means more distant galaxies recede faster, not because they’re flying through space, but because
        <em>space between us and them is increasing</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>Redshift: Why Light Gets Stretched</h3>
      <p>
        As space expands, light traveling through it is stretched to longer (redder) wavelengths—this is called <strong>cosmological redshift</strong>, denoted by <strong>z</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cosmological redshift:</strong> Caused by expansion of space (dominant on intergalactic scales).</li>
        <li><strong>Doppler redshift:</strong> Due to relative motion through space (like a siren’s pitch change).</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational redshift:</strong> Light loses energy climbing out of strong gravitational fields.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For small redshifts (nearby galaxies), redshift approximately tracks velocity (Doppler-like). For large distances, the full cosmological model is needed to convert <em>z</em> to distance and look-back time.
      </p>

      <h3>Evidence for an Expanding Universe</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Galaxy redshifts:</strong> Systematic trend—more distant galaxies show greater redshift.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):</strong> Afterglow of the early universe, a snapshot from ~380,000 years after the Big Bang.</li>
        <li><strong>Primordial elements:</strong> Abundances of hydrogen, helium, and lithium match Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Large-scale structure:</strong> The “cosmic web” of galaxies follows patterns explained by growth in an expanding universe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Fast Is the Universe Expanding?</h3>
      <p>
        The exact value of the Hubble constant H<sub>0</sub> is measured using multiple methods (e.g., supernova distances and the CMB).
        While different techniques give slightly different values, all indicate ongoing expansion. The expansion rate also changes over time:
        early on it slowed due to gravity, but in the last few billion years it has sped up—an effect attributed to <strong>dark energy</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>What Expansion Means (and Doesn’t Mean)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Galaxies aren’t “exploding” away:</strong> On local scales, gravity holds galaxies and clusters together.</li>
        <li><strong>No center of the expansion:</strong> Every observer, anywhere, sees other distant galaxies receding on average.</li>
        <li><strong>Superluminal recession speeds:</strong> Distant galaxies can recede faster than light due to space expansion; this doesn’t violate relativity because nothing moves through space faster than light.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Redshift, Distance, and Look-back Time</h3>
      <p>
        Higher redshift generally means greater distance and earlier cosmic time. When we observe a galaxy at high <em>z</em>, we see it as it was billions of years ago,
        because light took that long to reach us through the expanding cosmos.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Hubble’s Law Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides a distance ladder rung: redshift helps estimate cosmic distances (with a cosmological model).</li>
        <li>Anchors the age and size of the observable universe.</li>
        <li>Connects observations (redshift) to theory (general relativity and cosmology).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Hubble’s Law and cosmological redshift reveal a dynamic universe whose fabric is stretching with time. From nearby galaxies to the most distant
        objects we can see, the expansion story ties together the universe’s past, present, and future—and our place within it.

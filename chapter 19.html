      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>For decades, space exploration was dominated by government agencies like NASA and Roscosmos. However, in the 21st century, private companies have entered the race, bringing innovation, competition, and the dream of space travel for everyone.</p>

      <h3>The Rise of Private Space Companies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Founded by Elon Musk, it developed the Falcon rockets and <em>Dragon</em> spacecraft, achieving reusable rockets and missions to the ISS.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Origin:</strong> Jeff Bezos’ company focused on suborbital tourism with <em>New Shepard</em> and future orbital rockets.</li>
        <li><strong>Virgin Galactic:</strong> Richard Branson’s company that offers suborbital flights for paying tourists.</li>
        <li><strong>Boeing and Others:</strong> Working alongside NASA to build crewed spacecraft like the Starliner.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Space Tourism Becomes Reality</h3>
      <p>What once seemed like science fiction is now possible. Wealthy tourists have already flown to space aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and private companies are now offering commercial suborbital flights.</p>

      <h3>Challenges and Concerns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>High ticket prices limit space tourism to the wealthy elite.</li>
        <li>Safety remains a major issue in commercial spaceflight.</li>
        <li>Environmental impact of frequent launches is being studied.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future of Space Tourism</h3>
      <p>In the near future, private companies plan to offer orbital hotels, lunar tourism, and even missions to Mars. What was once exclusive to astronauts may soon become accessible to ordinary people.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Private companies have revolutionized space exploration, making it faster, cheaper, and more ambitious. Space tourism is only the beginning of a new era where humanity may truly become a spacefaring civilization.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Robotic missions have played a crucial role in exploring the Solar System. They act as pioneers, reaching destinations too dangerous or distant for humans. From studying planetary atmospheres to searching for signs of life, these missions provide invaluable data about our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

      <h3>Pioneering Missions</h3>
      <p>Early spacecraft like <strong>Mariner</strong> and <strong>Pioneer</strong> opened the way by sending back the first close-up images of planets such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. These missions marked humanity’s first robotic steps into interplanetary exploration.</p>

      <h3>Exploring Mars</h3>
      <p>Mars has been one of the most studied planets by robotic explorers. NASA’s <strong>Viking landers</strong> in the 1970s were the first to search for life, while modern rovers such as <strong>Spirit</strong>, <strong>Opportunity</strong>, <strong>Curiosity</strong>, and <strong>Perseverance</strong> have examined its geology, climate, and potential habitability.</p>

      <h3>Voyager and Outer Planets</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Voyager 1 and 2 missions</strong>, launched in 1977, conducted grand tours of the outer planets, capturing iconic images of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Voyager 1 is now in interstellar space, still sending signals back to Earth.</p>

      <h3>Other Notable Missions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Galileo (1989–2003):</strong> Studied Jupiter and its moons in detail.</li>
        <li><strong>Cassini–Huygens (1997–2017):</strong> Explored Saturn, its rings, and landed on Titan.</li>
        <li><strong>New Horizons (2006–present):</strong> Provided the first close-up images of Pluto and continues into the Kuiper Belt.</li>
        <li><strong>Juno (2011–present):</strong> Currently studying Jupiter’s atmosphere and magnetic fields.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future of Robotic Exploration</h3>
      <p>Future missions include sending robots to Europa and Enceladus to search for subsurface oceans, as well as more advanced Mars rovers and asteroid probes. These robotic explorers lay the foundation for future human exploration by gathering essential data.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Robotic missions have transformed our understanding of the Solar System. They extend humanity’s reach, explore the unknown, and prepare the way for human explorers. Each mission brings us closer to answering the ultimate question: Are we alone in the universe?</p>

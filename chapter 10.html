      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Human missions to the <strong>Moon</strong> and <strong>Mars</strong> represent some of the most ambitious goals in space exploration. These missions aim to expand human presence beyond Earth, push the limits of science and technology, and answer profound questions about life and the universe.</p>

      <h3>The Apollo Moon Landings</h3>
      <p>The first human missions beyond Earth were NASA’s <strong>Apollo program</strong>. In 1969, <em>Apollo 11</em> made history when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo missions successfully landed astronauts on the lunar surface, bringing back valuable rock samples and scientific data.</p>

      <h3>Artemis Program – Return to the Moon</h3>
      <p>NASA’s <strong>Artemis program</strong> aims to return astronauts to the Moon by the mid-2020s. The mission goals include establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, testing technologies for future Mars exploration, and landing the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface.</p>

      <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
      <p>Mars is considered the next great frontier for human exploration. It has a thin atmosphere, signs of ancient water, and similarities to Earth that make it a candidate for future colonization. Scientists believe that studying Mars could reveal whether life ever existed there and how humans might survive on other planets.</p>

      <h3>Challenges of Human Mars Missions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> A round trip to Mars could take over two years.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Astronauts would be exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Food, water, and oxygen would need to be produced or recycled on Mars.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> New spacecraft, habitats, and life-support systems must be developed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Future Plans</h3>
      <p>NASA, along with international partners and private companies like SpaceX, is actively preparing for human Mars missions in the 2030s. Technologies tested on the ISS and Moon will be stepping stones for Mars exploration.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>From the Apollo Moon landings to the upcoming Artemis and Mars missions, humanity is steadily moving toward becoming a multi-planetary species. These missions not only push scientific boundaries but also inspire future generations to dream beyond Earth.</p>
